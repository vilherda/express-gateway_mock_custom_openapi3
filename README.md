# README

This sample project is based on the project [express-gateway-plugin-openapi3-mock-server](https://github.com/vilherda/express-gateway-plugin-openapi3-mock-server).

The only objective is to represent the main use case adding other plugins like 'log' and [express-gateway-plugin-errors](https://github.com/josemf/express-gateway-plugin-errors).

So, once started you can visit the local endpoint on your browser:

- <http://localhost:8080/dummy>

And you will see the next response:

```json
{
    "status": "GET ok"
}
```
